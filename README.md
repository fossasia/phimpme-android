By participating, you are expected to uphold this code style. Please report issues here https://github.com/fossasia/phimpme-android/issues

### Branch Policy
We have the following branches
 * **development**
     All development goes on in this branch. If you're making a contribution,
     you are supposed to make a pull request to _development_.
     Make sure it passes a build check on Travis

     It is advisable to clone only the development branch using the following command:

    `git clone -b <branch> <remote_repo>`

    Example:

    `git clone -b my-branch git@github.com:user/myproject.git`

    Alternative (no public key setup needed):

    `git clone -b my-branch https://git@github.com/username/myproject.git`

    With Git 1.7.10 and later, add --single-branch to prevent fetching of all branches. Example, with development branch:

    `git clone -b development --single-branch https://github.com/username/phimpme-android.git`

 * **master**
   This contains the stable code. After significant features/bugfixes are accumulated on development, we move it to master.

## Development Setup

Before you begin, you should have already downloaded the Android Studio SDK and set it up correctly. You can find a guide on how to do this here: [Setting up Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio)

### Setting up the Android Project

1. Download the *phimpme-android* project source. You can do this either by forking and cloning the repository (recommended if you plan on pushing changes) or by downloading it as a ZIP file and extracting it.

2. Install the NDK in Android Studio.

3. Open Android Studio, you will see a **Welcome to Android** window. Under Quick Start, select *Import Project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)*

4. Navigate to the directory where you saved the phimpme-android project, select the root folder of the project (the folder named "phimpme-android"), and hit OK. Android Studio should now begin building the project with Gradle.

5. Once this process is complete and Android Studio opens, check the Console for any build errors.

    - *Note:* If you receive a Gradle sync error titled, "failed to find ...", you should click on the link below the error message (if available) that says *Install missing platform(s) and sync project* and allow Android studio to fetch you what is missing.

6. Download this [OpenCV-android-sdk](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/download/2.4.13.3/opencv-2.4.13.3-android-sdk.zip) zip file and extract it.

     - Copy all the files from *"OpenCV-android-sdk/sdk/native/3rdparty"* to *"phimpme-android/app/src/main/3rdparty"* (create directory if it doesn't exist)
     - Copy all the files from *"OpenCV-android-sdk/sdk/native/libs"* to *"phimpme-android/app/src/main/jniLibs"* (create directory if it doesn't exist)
     - Now build your project. If your build fails then try deleting these build directories *"phimpme-android/app/.externalNativeBuild"* and *"phimpme-android/app/build"*, if they exist and run the build again.

7. Once all build errors have been resolved, you should be all set to build the app and test it.

8. To Build the app, go to *Build > Make Project* (or alternatively press the Make Project icon in the toolbar).

9. If the app was built successfully, you can test it by running it on either a real device or an emulated one by going to *Run > Run 'app'* or pressing the Run icon in the toolbar.

10. **To enable the sharing features to a different account, add API_KEY/ APP_ID associated with accounts**. Add the Keys in `constant.java` and `strings.xml`. Following are the links to developer pages of account. Go there to create apps and get keys.
