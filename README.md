## Quick Start

### Step 1) Fork this repo

![Step 1](/images/fork.png "Step 1")

Your Awesome App Landing Page will often be viewable immediately at `http://username.github.io/awesome-app-landing-page` (if it's not, you can often force it to build by completing step 2)

**IMPORTANT**: Don't forget to replace **username** with the GitHub **user name** or **organization name** you forked the repo to.

### Step 2) Edit `_config.yml` to customize

Enter required information:
- **App Name**
- **iOS App ID** (10 Digit Numeric App ID)

Optionally enter additional information:
- Android App ID (e.g. com.example.appname)
- App Icon (will auto-magically load if left blank)
- App Screenshot (will auto-magically load if left blank)
- Marketing Header
- Marketing Description
- Social Links
- Hide/Show App Icon
- Hide/Show Smart App Banner
- Full Screen Background Image (optional)
- Site Title & Description
- iTunes Affiliate Token
- Google Analytics Site ID

Making a change to `_config.yml` (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at `http://username.github.io/repository-name` - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it'll appear soon

> There are 2 different ways that you can make changes to your page's files:

> 1. Edit files within your repository in the browser at GitHub.com (shown below).
> 2. Clone down your repository and make updates locally, then push them to your GitHub repository.

## iTunes Affiliate Token

If you'd like to make a little extra revenue from your paid iOS app, sign up for the iTunes Affiliate Program and enter your affiliate token in the config file.

Sign up here: http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/

**Disclaimer**: If left empty, developer's affiliate token will be used. (this is a way for me, the author, to make a few pennies for my efforts without costing you a dime ðŸ˜„)

## Local Development (Optional)

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down your fork `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git`
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
4. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.
